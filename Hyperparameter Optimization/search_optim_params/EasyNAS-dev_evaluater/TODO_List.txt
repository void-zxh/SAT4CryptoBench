1. Search Space:
1.2 update FlattenSampledDiscreteSpace as FlattenView
1.3 Build BN via SearchModule when bn_per_ch = True
1.4 load_state_dict: state_dict_sampler_weights should be separately considered, which can differs from the sampler_weights in the current search space
1.5 ContinuousSpace: how to set sampler's parameters
1.6 ContinuousSpace: initialize a tensor

2. Search Method:
2.1 add BO
2.2 add EA
2.3 add RL
2.4 add state_dict and load_state_dict for each search method

3. Evaluation method for NAS
3.1 complete SPOS, i.e., load supernet weights to sampled architecture
3.2 add zero-cost proxies

4. Others
4.1 We should define root_path in engine, and each save_root/root_path/save_path in hooks should be relative path w.r.t. the root_path in engine. Otherwise the multi-worker will mislead the saving of checkpoint.
4.2 After searching, the cfg yaml should be checked and updated manually. How to make it easy for the user?


TODO order:
4.1 4.2 1.4 2.1 3.2 2.3
